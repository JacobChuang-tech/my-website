                <blockquote>“If every runner’s answer and finish line were the same, running wouldn’t be so captivating.” <em>Let the Strong Wind Blow</em></blockquote>
                <p>This newsletter is quite special, mainly because I’ve recently been engrossed in novels, dramas, and movies, and I’d like to share with you the novel that ranks number one in my heart this year: <em>Let the Strong Wind Blow</em>.</p>
                <p><em>Let the Strong Wind Blow</em> follows ten university students who, under highly coincidental circumstances, decide to tackle Japan’s renowned Hakone Ekiden relay marathon. Each leg spans 20-23 kilometers, with the route running from Hakone to Tokyo and back. Only two of these students are passionate about running, while the remaining eight are nearly complete novices in long-distance running.</p>
                <p>It might seem like a passionate sports novel, but it’s more a story of individuals dialoguing with themselves through running.</p>
                <p>During their 20-kilometer runs, each protagonist reflects on different aspects of their lives.</p>
                <p>One recalls their past efforts to pass the bar exam in university to support their single mother after a divorce, hoping to provide her with a better life. But after her remarriage, they felt lost, realizing her new husband could easily give her what she wanted, leading them to distance themselves from home.  
                While running, seeing their mother cheer them on, they suddenly understood: they and their mother are distinct individuals. Her happiness is enough, and they are now running toward their own goals and direction—different from hers. This brought them relief, and they decided to embrace their own life.  
                The protagonist “Aruki” finds liberation during the 20-kilometer run, realizing they are no longer alone.</p>
                <p>While running, these individuals refocus on their life experiences—some on love, some on their dedication to running, others on life’s regrets. Through running, these personal reflections return to their lives.</p>
                <p>One of the main characters, Hai-ni, says: “Believing that effort alone guarantees success is a form of arrogance.” Because in the world, there will always be those who work harder and have more talent. Thinking that effort alone ensures success might overestimate one’s own abilities.</p>
                <p>But does this mean we should stop trying? Or is it a call to refocus on ourselves?  
                What I need to consider isn’t just that effort leads to success. My focus shouldn’t be on success or failure, but on whether my efforts bring me closer to my own goals.</p>
                <p>Do you exercise? What do you think about while exercising?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wondering what to eat after exercising while battling your inner diet police? (I want salt-crusted chicken → No! Eating salt-crusted chicken is a crime, you’ll be detained!)</li>
                    <li>Thinking about funny things, like Taiwanese politics? Or always getting lost?</li>
                    <li>Reflecting on anger-inducing matters, like a lazy coworker who brags at work or a boss who steals your afternoon tea?</li>
                    <li>Contemplating warm things, like the cozy seats on the MRT?</li>
                    <li>Pondering joyful things, like the breakfast shop auntie who keeps calling me handsome, or the massage parlor auntie who grabbed me?</li>
                    <li>Tuning into yourself—those
